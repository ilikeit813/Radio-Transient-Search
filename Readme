Transient Radio Search
====================

Python Transient Radio Search Project

Pipeline:
FFT.py
    Use this code to do FFT on raw binary observation data to Numpy arry format for further analysis.
dedisperse.py
    This code Read in a spectrogram in Numpy array form,
    mask out the radio frequency interference, use MPI to parallel compute the dedispersed
    time series with Dispersion measure trials, record candicates over criterions in
    text files.

SQL.py
    Convert the text files into SQL format database.

web.py or plot.py
    web.py: Read in the SQL database and plot the Cordes&McLaughlin style plot in user's browser.
    plot.py: Read in text file plot the Cordes&McLaughlin style plot on your screen.
